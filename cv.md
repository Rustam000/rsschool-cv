## Code example:

Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.
E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.
If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
    if (arr[i] + 1 !== arr[i + 1]) {
      return arr[i + 1]
    }
  }
  return null
}
```
